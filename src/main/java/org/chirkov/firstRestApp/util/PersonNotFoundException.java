     * As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
     * <i>suppressed exceptions</i> (in conjunction with the {@code
     * try}-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
     * suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
     * beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
     * depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
     * regarded as typical:
     *
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
     *         at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
     *         at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
     *         Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
     *                 at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *                 at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
     *                 ... 1 more
     * </pre>
     * Note that the "... n more" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
     * just as it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
     * indented beyond their "containing exceptions."
     *
     * <p>An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
     * exceptions:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
     *         at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
     *         Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
     *                 at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *                 at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     *         Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
     *                 at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *                 at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     * Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
     *         at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
     * </pre>
     * Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block

     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * <b>When running in a Java virtual machine in which finalization has been
     * disabled or removed, the garbage collector will never call
     * {@code finalize()}. In a Java virtual machine in which finalization is
     * enabled, the garbage collector might call {@code finalize} only after an
     * indefinite delay.</b>
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the {@code Exception} raised by this method
     * @apiNote Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options
     * for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the
     * lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds.
     * {@link Reference#reachabilityFence} can be used to ensure that
     * objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
     * <p>
     * A subclass should avoid overriding the {@code finalize} method
     * unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up
     * before the instance is collected.
     * Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors.
     * If a subclass overrides {@code finalize} it must invoke the superclass
     * finalizer explicitly.
     * To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain,
     * the subclass should use a {@code try-finally} block to ensure
     * {@code super.finalize()} is always invoked. For example,
     * <pre>{@code      @Override
